# FVTT Custom Journal Theming - The Journals of your Dreams!

Welcome to the inner sanctum of your own personal playground to design your
own wonderful-looking journals! Having mutliple different active journal 
themes (much like say, character sheets in the D&D 5e system) is something 
I eventually want to tackle, but is not yet implemented as journals are not
natively extensible the same way, as far as I've seen, so if anyone wants to
reach out with a solution on how to do that, it would be greatly appreciated!
Otherwise, see below for the general variables you can set to better customize
your experience, whether it is to get that unique Sci-Fi look, make a
dark theme or log your adventures in a cuter, funnier or grimer theme. Have fun!

## Personalizing your journals

If you want to customize the look of your journals, you can simply
modify these values for a uniform change. It is unrecommended to individually
change values for elements, as these changes can become hard to track and to
keep uniform, but the power is in your hands! It is after all quite possible 
that my original settings do not allow for the exact thing you want, or we do 
not perfectly agree on what belongs as an "accent", and that's ok :)

A final word of warning:
Especially since there is currently no concept of multiple "themes" and no
permanence of any of your changes, though updates aren't likely to come up all
that often for this little module, they might still happen (such as perhaps to 
introduce such theming) and ANY CHANGES YOU WOULD HAVE MADE WOULD BE LOST.

> **PLEASE SAVE ANY CHANGES YOU WANT TO KEEP OUTSIDE OF THE MODULE TO SET THOSE BACK IN CASE OF A MODULE UPDATE.**
