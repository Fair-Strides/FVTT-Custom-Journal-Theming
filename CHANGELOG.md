# 1.1.3

- **Applied styling for minimal compatibility with MEME.** As I am not using this module myself, there may be some untested areas, so if you see anything amiss that specifically seems to be caused by the interaction between Custom Journal and MEME, please add a comment under https://github.com/Sanyella/FVTT-Custom-Journal-Theming/issues/31. Also note that this is for *minimal* compatibility, and that means the styles offered by Custom Journal aren't supported by the MEME editor, since there are no style dropdown. 

# 1.1.2

- Fixed styles dropdown not showing Custom Journal's unique styles for Foundry version 7.3. This change is still compatible with the current stable release (0.6.6).

# 1.1.1

- Added changelog

- Fixed text color in tables

- Changed the CSS variables for the dark-slate theme to reflect the `--[theme]-journal-[variable]` pattern, instead of being `--[theme]-[variable]`

- Added github workflows
